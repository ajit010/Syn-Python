•	Utilize basic Python concepts like variables, data types, and flow control.
•	Implement functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.
•	Organize functions into modules and packages for better code organization.
•	Implement a class for representing an employee with attributes and methods.
•	Integrate the program with an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) like MySQL using libraries such as mysql-connector
•	Use debugging techniques to identify and fix any errors or issues.



2. Online Shopping System:

•	Develop a Python program for an online shopping platform.
•	Implement flow control to manage user interactions such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
•	Define functions to handle shopping operations like adding products, removing products, and calculating the total bill.
•	Organize code into modules and packages based on functionality.
•	Create classes to represent products, shopping carts, and orders with appropriate attributes and methods.
•	Connect the application to an RDBMS to store product information and order history securely.
•	Debug the program to ensure it functions correctly and handles errors gracefully
